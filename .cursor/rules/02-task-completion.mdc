# Task Completion

## Pre-Completion Checklist
- [ ] Backward compatible
- [ ] Matches existing patterns
- [ ] Errors handled and logged
- [ ] Input validation (user endpoints)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles
- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] README updated (if API/setup/env changed)

## Mandatory Verification Commands
Before declaring ANY task complete, run these commands and show output:

```bash
npm run test        # All tests must pass
npm run lint        # No errors allowed
npm run build       # Must compile successfully
```

**Do NOT skip these steps. Claims without evidence = not done.**

## Delivery Summary
1. **Files**: List modified files
2. **Changes**: What and why
3. **Tests**: Coverage confirmation
4. **Risks**: Concerns or follow-ups

```markdown
<!-- ❌ NEVER - vague summary -->
Done. Updated some files.

<!-- ✅ CORRECT - detailed summary -->
## Delivery Summary

**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/user.service.ts` - Added email validation
- `src/controllers/user.controller.ts` - Updated createUser endpoint
- `src/services/user.service.test.ts` - Added 3 new tests

**Changes:**
- Added email format validation before user creation
- Returns 400 Bad Request for invalid emails (previously 500)

**Tests:**
- 3 new tests added (valid email, invalid format, duplicate email)
- All 47 tests passing, 85% coverage

**Risks:**
- None identified. Change is backward compatible.
```

## Rollback Strategy
If change causes problems:
1. `git revert <commit>` → Push
2. Analyze what went wrong
3. Fix properly in new commit

**Never** force push or amend pushed commits.

## Debugging Approach (Systematic - 4 Phases)
```
1. REPRODUCE   → Can you trigger it reliably?
2. ISOLATE     → What's the minimal failing case?
3. ROOT CAUSE  → Why is it happening? (not just where)
4. FIX+VERIFY  → Fix the cause, prove it's fixed
```
- One change at a time
- Read full error messages
- Stop after 3 failed attempts, reassess
- **Evidence over claims** - Show proof it's fixed

```markdown
<!-- ❌ NEVER - random changes without understanding -->
"I'll try changing this... nope. Maybe this... still broken."

<!-- ✅ CORRECT - systematic approach -->
## Bug: Users can't login after password reset

**1. REPRODUCE**
- Reset password for test@example.com
- Try to login with new password → 401 Unauthorized
- Reproducible 100% of the time

**2. ISOLATE**
- Direct DB query shows password hash is updated ✓
- bcrypt.compare() returns false even with correct password
- Issue: hash has extra whitespace from form input

**3. ROOT CAUSE**
- `resetPassword()` doesn't trim the new password
- Hash includes trailing space, but login trims input
- Location: src/services/auth.service.ts:45

**4. FIX+VERIFY**
- Added `.trim()` to password in resetPassword()
- Test: Reset + login now works
- Added test case for whitespace passwords
```

## Self-Review
Before submitting work, verify both:
1. **Requirements** - Does it solve the actual problem?
2. **Quality** - Is the code clean and maintainable?

Fix any issues before marking complete.
