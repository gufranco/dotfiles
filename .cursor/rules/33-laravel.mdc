# Laravel

## Conventions
- Use PHP 8.3+ features where appropriate; follow Laravel conventions and best practices.
- File names: kebab-case (e.g. `my-class-file.php`).
- Class and Enum names: PascalCase (e.g. `MyClass`).
- Method names: camelCase (e.g. `myMethod`).
- Variable and property names: snake_case (e.g. `my_variable`).
- Constants and enum cases: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g. `MY_CONSTANT`).

## Package Development
- Use spatie/laravel-package-tools (or equivalent) as a starting point; implement a default Pint configuration for code style.
- Prefer helpers over facades when possible; focus on DX: type safety, autocompletion, docblocks.
- Outline directory structure and purpose of main dirs; describe how the package integrates into a Laravel app.
- Provide a testing strategy (unit, feature tests) and documentation (README, usage examples, API reference).

## General
- Keep business logic in services/models; keep controllers thin and focused on HTTP.
- Use form requests for validation; use Eloquent and query builder; avoid raw SQL unless needed for performance.
