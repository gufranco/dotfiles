# Angular

## Conventions
- Use Angular 18+ and TypeScript; follow Angular style guide; include all required imports and proper naming.
- Do not nest code more than 2 levels deep; prefer explicit iteration (e.g. `forNext`-style) over deep `forEach`/`for-of` when it improves clarity.
- Obey `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, `.editorconfig`; keep JSDoc when refactoring.

## Limits
- Functions/methods: at most 4 parameters; at most 50 executable lines per function.
- Line length: keep to 80 characters (or project standard).

## Components and Templates
- Use standalone components when possible; keep templates simple and use structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) with trackBy when needed.
- Prefer reactive forms; use signals (Angular 16+) for component state when appropriate.
- Focus on performance, readability, and maintainability; double-check before answering; if unsure, ask instead of guessing.

## Testing
- Use Jest (or Karma/Jasmine per project); test components and services; follow project testing conventions.
