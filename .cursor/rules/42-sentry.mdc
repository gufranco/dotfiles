# Sentry Automation

## Identifiers
- **Organization**: Use slug (e.g., 'my-org'), not display name
- **Project**: Use slug (e.g., 'my-project'), not display name
- **Issue IDs**: Numeric integers
- **Event IDs**: UUIDs (32-char hex strings)

## Search Query Syntax
```
is:unresolved                    # Unresolved issues
is:resolved                      # Resolved issues
assigned:me                      # Assigned to current user
assigned:team-slug               # Assigned to team
!has:release                     # Issues without a release
first-release:1.0.0              # First seen in release
times-seen:>100                  # Seen more than 100 times
browser:Chrome                   # Filter by browser tag
```

## Release Management
1. Create release with version string
2. Associate with projects array
3. Deploy to environment (production, staging)
4. Upload source maps for readable stack traces

### Version Formats
- Semantic: `1.0.0`, `2.1.3-beta`
- Commit SHA: `abc123def456`
- Custom: `deploy-20240115`

## Alert Rules
- **Project-level**: Issue alerts for a specific project
- **Org-level**: Metric alerts across projects

### Alert Components
- `conditions`: Trigger conditions
- `actions`: What happens when triggered
- `filters`: Event filters
- `frequency`: How often (in minutes)

## Best Practices
- Always resolve project names to slugs first
- Use cursor-based pagination for large result sets
- Inspect individual events for detailed stack traces
- Create releases for every deployment
- Upload source maps for production debugging
