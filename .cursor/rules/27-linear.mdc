## Common Workflows

### Creating Issues from Code Tasks
When identifying work that needs tracking:
1. Create issue with descriptive title
2. Set appropriate priority based on impact
3. Add technical details in description

### Linking PRs to Issues
- Reference issue ID in PR title: `TICKET-123: description`
- Use `Fixes TICKET-123` in PR description to auto-close

### Issue Updates
Update issues when:
- Starting work (status: "In Progress")
- Blocked (add comment explaining blocker)
- Ready for review (status: "In Review")
- Completed (status: "Done")

## Best Practices

- **Always search first** before creating to avoid duplicates
- **Use clear titles** that describe the problem or feature
- **Add context** in description: what, why, and acceptance criteria
- **Set priority** based on user impact and urgency
- **Link related issues** in description when applicable

## Issue Title Format
```
<type>: <short description>

Examples:
- Bug: Login fails with special characters in password
- Feature: Add dark mode toggle to settings
- Chore: Update dependencies to latest versions
```

## Description Template
```markdown
## Problem

## Solution

## Acceptance Criteria
